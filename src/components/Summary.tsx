        After my Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering, I spent a few
        years as a professional proofreader while I planned my next move. I
        eventually realized I missed technical problem-solving, so I spent my
        evenings teaching myself React and TypeScript to get back into
        engineering. Now, I build dashboards for EU-funded cybersecurity
        research projects. It turns out that the same eye for detail I used to
        catch typos in manuscripts is exactly what I need to build clean,
        functional user interfaces.
